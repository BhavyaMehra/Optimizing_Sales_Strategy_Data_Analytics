# Optimizing Sales Strategies – Data Analyst Certification Project

This project was completed as part of the **Data Analyst Certification** on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), designed to simulate a real-world business scenario. It focuses on analyzing sales data for a company that sells pens and printers, with the goal of identifying the most effective sales strategy to **maximize revenue** and **optimize resource allocation**.

---

## Project Overview

The company uses three sales strategies: **Email**, **Phone Call**, and a combination of both. Management wants to determine which of these approaches yields the best results and how to scale them efficiently. As a data analyst, my task was to:

- **Validate and explore** the sales data.
- **Analyze** sales performance by strategy and geography.
- **Define** a relevant performance metric.
- **Support decisions** with actionable, data-driven insights.

---

## Objectives

- Identify which sales strategy drives the highest revenue per customer.
- Uncover regional trends to determine where to focus marketing efforts.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for resource allocation.
- Create a simple, meaningful metric to monitor future performance.

---

## Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning & Validation** (handling missing values, ensuring consistency)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- **Group-by Analysis** for strategy-wise and region-wise comparisons
- **Visualization** of trends and distributions to communicate findings clearly
- **Metric Design**: Defined **Revenue per Customer** as the core KPI

---

## Key Findings

- **Email** contributed the highest share of revenue (50%), followed by **Phone Calls** (33%) and **Email + Call** (17%).
- However, **Revenue per Customer** was **highest** for the **Email + Call** strategy, indicating higher effectiveness despite fewer total sales.
- **Top 7 states** (e.g., California, Texas, New York) generated **67% of total revenue**, making them prime targets for optimized strategies.

---

## Final Recommendations

- **Scale up** the *Email + Call* approach for high-value customers to maximize ROI.
- **Improve Email-only campaigns** by enhancing content, timing, and personalization.
- **Focus marketing efforts** on top-performing states to drive further growth.
- **Reduce dependency** on Call-only outreach due to lower customer yield.
- Continuously **track Revenue per Customer** to adapt strategies based on performance.

## Final Outcome (Quantitative Impact)

| Strategy       | Revenue Share | Customers | Revenue per Customer | Avg. Call Time |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Email          | 50%           | High      | Medium                | 0 mins         |
| Call           | 33%           | Medium    | Low                   | 30 mins        |
| Email + Call   | 17%           | Low       | **Highest**           | **10 mins**    |

**Insight**: The *Email + Call* strategy not only delivers the highest revenue per customer, but also requires only **10 minutes of call time** per customer, compared to **30 minutes** for the Call-only strategy—**a 67% reduction in time** while achieving higher revenue efficiency.
